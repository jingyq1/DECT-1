# DECT: DD-net Enhanced CT

DECT (DD-Net Enhanced CT) is a deep learning-based COVID-19 testing framework, which is composed of post-CT Enhancement AI to enhance the quality of CT scans, segmentation AI to segment lung region from CT scans, and CT Classification AI to predict the possibility for COVID-19. 
Enhancement AI is based on DenseNet and Deconvolution (DDNet) architecture. The AI generates high-resolution enhanced CT images. [1]
Segmentation AI is based on a 3D version of AHNet. Classification AI uses 3D DenseNet-121 architecture. [2]
Our early results show good improvement in the accuracy of classification of CT scans enhanced using DD-Net.

## Installation

Use the package manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages. 

Docker installation instruction: example_use_analysisAI.pdf

```bash
conda install numpy
conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
conda install scikit-image
conda install -c anaconda pillow
pip install scikit-image
pip install pathlib
```
## Hardware requirements

PyTorch CUDA requires Nvidia GPU with compute capability 6.0 or higher. The network can also run on CPU at low speed.

## How to run
1. Prepare 3D CT scans (.tif) and run the enhancement model. The enhancement model will generate pre-enhanced (original) CT scans (.nii) and post-enhanced CT scans.
2. Run the segmentation model. The program will automatically copy the imediate result generated by enhancement model and generate segmentaion mask images (.nii).
3. Run the classification model. The program will automatically copy the segmentation mask image generated by segmentation models. The classification model will generate the positive and negative possibility score of each CT scan in a table (.csv).
